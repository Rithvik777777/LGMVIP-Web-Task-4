A calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JS is a web-based tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. HTML sets up the structure, CSS styles the layout, and JS handles the functionality. Numeric buttons and operators are used for input, and a display shows the result. JS handles button clicks, evaluates expressions, and updates the display dynamically. This interactive combination allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, creating a functional and user-friendly calculator.
